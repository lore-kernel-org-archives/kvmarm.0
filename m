Sure; I meant that those should be handled in the kernel rather than
going to host userspace and back.

I was suggesting was that userspace would opt into taking ownership of
all HVC calls, then explicitly opt-in to the kernel handling specific
(sets of) calls.

There are probably issues with that, but I suspect defining "all
undandled calls" will be problematic otherwise.

Thanks,
Mark.
